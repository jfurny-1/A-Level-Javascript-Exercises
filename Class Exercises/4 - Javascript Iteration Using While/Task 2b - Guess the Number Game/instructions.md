# Task 2b - Guess the Number Game

## Objective
Use a `while` loop to create a simple number guessing game.

## Instructions
- The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100 (generate this in your JS).
- The page has an input for guesses, a button, and an output area.
- When the button is clicked, check the guess and give feedback ("Too high", "Too low", or "Correct!").
- Use a `while` loop to keep prompting for guesses until the correct number is guessed.
- Display the number of attempts when the user wins.
- You must add your own event listener in JavaScript to trigger the code when the button is clicked.

## Steps
1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100 in your `script.js` file.
2. Add an event listener to the button.
3. Use a `while` loop to keep checking guesses until the user is correct.
4. Display feedback and the number of attempts in the output area.
