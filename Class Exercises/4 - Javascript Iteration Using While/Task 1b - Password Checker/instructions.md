# Task 1b - Password Checker

## Objective
Use a `while` loop to repeatedly prompt the user for a password until the correct one is entered.

## Instructions
- The page has a password input, a button, and a message area.
- When the button is clicked, check if the entered password matches the correct password (set in your JS, e.g., "letmein").
- If incorrect, display a message and let the user try again. If correct, display a success message.
- You must use a `while` loop to keep prompting until the correct password is entered.
- You must add your own event listener in JavaScript to trigger the code when the button is clicked.

## Steps
1. Add an event listener to the button in your `script.js` file.
2. When the button is clicked, use a `while` loop to check the password and allow repeated attempts.
3. Display appropriate messages in the message area.
