# Task 2a - Sum Until Zero

## Objective
Use a `while` loop to sum numbers entered by the user until they enter 0.

## Instructions
- The page has a number input, a button, and an output area.
- Each time the button is clicked, add the entered number to a running total.
- When the user enters 0, display the total sum and reset for a new session.
- You must use a `while` loop to keep accepting numbers until 0 is entered.
- You must add your own event listener in JavaScript to trigger the code when the button is clicked.

## Steps
1. Add an event listener to the button in your `script.js` file.
2. Use a `while` loop to keep accepting numbers and summing them until 0 is entered.
3. Display the total sum in the output area when finished.
