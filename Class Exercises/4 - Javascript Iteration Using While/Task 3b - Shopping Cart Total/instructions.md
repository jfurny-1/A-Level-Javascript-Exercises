# Task 3b - Shopping Cart Total

## Objective
Use a `while` loop to total item prices entered by the user, simulating a shopping cart.

## Instructions
- The page has a number input for item price, a button to add the item, and an output area.
- Each time the button is clicked, add the entered price to a running total and count the item.
- When the user enters 0, display the total price and the number of items, then reset for a new session.
- You must use a `while` loop to keep accepting prices until 0 is entered.
- You must add your own event listener in JavaScript to trigger the code when the button is clicked.

## Steps
1. Add an event listener to the button in your `script.js` file.
2. Use a `while` loop to keep accepting prices and summing them until 0 is entered.
3. Display the total price and item count in the output area when finished.
