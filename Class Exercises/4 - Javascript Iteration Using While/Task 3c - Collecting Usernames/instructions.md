# Task 3c - Collecting Usernames

## Objective
Use a `while` loop to collect usernames entered by the user until they type "done".

## Instructions
- The page has a text input for usernames, a button to add the username, and an output area.
- Each time the button is clicked, add the entered username to a list.
- When the user enters "done", display all collected usernames and reset for a new session.
- You must use a `while` loop to keep accepting usernames until "done" is entered.
- You must add your own event listener in JavaScript to trigger the code when the button is clicked.

## Steps
1. Add an event listener to the button in your `script.js` file.
2. Use a `while` loop to keep accepting usernames until "done" is entered.
3. Display the list of usernames in the output area when finished.
