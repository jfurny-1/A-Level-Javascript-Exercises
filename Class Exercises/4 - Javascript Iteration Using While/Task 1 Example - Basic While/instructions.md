# Task 1 Example - Basic While

## Objective
Learn how to use a simple `while` loop in JavaScript.

## Instructions
- There is a button on the page. When clicked, it should display the numbers 1 to 10 in order, each on a new line, in the output area.
- You must use a `while` loop to generate the numbers.
- You must add your own event listener in JavaScript to trigger the code when the button is clicked.

## Steps
1. Add an event listener to the button in your `script.js` file.
2. When the button is clicked, use a `while` loop to build a string containing the numbers 1 to 10, each on a new line.
3. Display the result in the output area provided in the HTML.
