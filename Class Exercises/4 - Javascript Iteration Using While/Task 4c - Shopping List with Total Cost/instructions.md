# Task 4c â€“ Shopping List with Total Cost

## Objective
Use a `while` loop and other techniques to build a shopping list, calculate the total, and find the most expensive item.

## Instructions
- The page has inputs for item name and price, a button to add the item, and an output area.
- Use a while loop to keep accepting items until the user enters "done" as the item name.
- Store item names and prices in arrays.
- At the end, display the full shopping list with prices, total cost, and the most expensive item.
- You must add your own event listener in JavaScript to trigger the code when the button is clicked.

## Steps
1. Add an event listener to the button in your `script.js` file.
2. Use a while loop to keep accepting items until "done" is entered as the name.
3. Store item names and prices in arrays.
4. When finished, display the shopping list, total cost, and the most expensive item in the output area.
