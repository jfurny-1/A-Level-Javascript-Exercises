# Task 1a - Count Up

## Objective
Practice using a `while` loop to count up to a user-specified number.

## Instructions
- The page has an input box for a number, a button, and an output area.
- When the button is clicked, display the numbers from 1 up to the number entered by the user, each on a new line, in the output area.
- You must use a `while` loop to generate the numbers.
- You must add your own event listener in JavaScript to trigger the code when the button is clicked.

## Steps
1. Add an event listener to the button in your `script.js` file.
2. When the button is clicked, read the number from the input box.
3. Use a `while` loop to build a string containing the numbers from 1 up to the entered number, each on a new line.
4. Display the result in the output area provided in the HTML.
