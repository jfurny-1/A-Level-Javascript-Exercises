# Task 4a â€“ ATM Withdrawal Simulator

## Objective
Use a `while` loop and other techniques to simulate ATM withdrawals and track transactions.

## Instructions
- The page has an input for starting balance, an input for withdrawal amount, a button to make a withdrawal, and an output area.
- User enters their starting balance and clicks a button to set it.
- User can then repeatedly enter withdrawal amounts and click a button to withdraw.
- Each withdrawal is checked: if enough funds, subtract and show new balance; if not, show error.
- Use a `while` loop to keep accepting withdrawals until the user enters 0 or balance is 0.
- At the end, display all successful withdrawals and the final balance.
- You must add your own event listeners in JavaScript to trigger the code when buttons are clicked.

## Steps
1. Add event listeners to the buttons in your `script.js` file.
2. Use a `while` loop to keep accepting withdrawals until 0 is entered or balance is 0.
3. Store successful withdrawals in an array.
4. Display the list of withdrawals and the final balance in the output area when finished.
