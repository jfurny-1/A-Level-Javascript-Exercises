# Task 4b â€“ Average Grade Calculator

## Objective
Use a `while` loop and other techniques to collect grades, validate input, and calculate statistics.

## Instructions
- The page has an input for grade, a button to add the grade, and an output area.
- Each grade must be between 0 and 100 (validate input).
- Use a while loop to keep accepting grades until the user enters -1.
- Store grades in an array.
- At the end, display all grades, the average, and the highest/lowest grade.
- You must add your own event listener in JavaScript to trigger the code when the button is clicked.

## Steps
1. Add an event listener to the button in your `script.js` file.
2. Use a while loop to keep accepting grades until -1 is entered.
3. Validate each grade and store valid grades in an array.
4. When finished, display the list of grades, the average, and the highest/lowest grade in the output area.
