# Task 3a - Hash Table Collision Handling (Fill in the Blanks)

Complete the missing code in the `storeCode` and `searchCode` functions to handle collisions using chain linking.

- Use the hash function to find the correct position.
- Store the code in the correct chain if it is not already present.
- Search for the code in the correct chain and return its position, or -1 if not found.

Test your code by storing, searching, and listing codes. Try codes that will collide!
