# Task 2a - Hashing for Data Storage (Fill in the Blanks)

Complete the missing part of the hash function in `script.js`.

- The function should loop through each digit in the code and update the sum.

- Use the hash to store, search, and list codes in the array.

Test your code by storing, searching, and listing codes.
