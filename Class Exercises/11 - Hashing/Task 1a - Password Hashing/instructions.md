# Task 1a - Password Hashing (Fill in the Blanks)

Complete the missing part of the hashing function in `script.js`.

- The function should loop through each character in the password and update the hash value.
- Fill in the blank to multiply the hash by a number and add the character code, then use modulo to keep the hash in range.

Test your code by entering a password and clicking "Hash Password".
