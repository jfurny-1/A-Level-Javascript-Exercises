# Task 1 Example - Password Hashing

This example demonstrates a simple password hashing algorithm. Enter a password and click "Hash Password" to see its hash value. The hashing function uses a basic algorithm for educational purposes (not secure for real applications).

- Try different passwords and see how the hash changes.
- Notice how the same password always produces the same hash.
