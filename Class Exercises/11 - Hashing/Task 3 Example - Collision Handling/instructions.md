# Task 3 Example - Hash Table Collision Handling

This example demonstrates how to handle collisions in a hash table using chain linking (arrays at each position).

- Enter a 6-digit code and store it in the hash table.
- If multiple codes hash to the same position, they are stored in a chain (array).
- You can search for a code and see its chain.
- List all chains in the hash table.

Try storing codes that add up to the same digit sum to see collisions in action!
